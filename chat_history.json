You're envisioning a spatial design tool tailored for homeowners, realtors, contractors, and designers, encompassing interior, exterior, landscaping, virtual staging, floorplan creation, and material overlay functionalities. This is an ambitious and exciting project!\n\nHere's a plan to get started with a React Native + Expo app:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen/Dashboard:** A welcoming screen showcasing the app's core functionalities with clear and intuitive icons for Interior Design, Exterior Design, Landscaping, Virtual Staging, Floorplan Creation, and Material Overlay.\n*   **Interior Design Module:** A basic interior design screen where users can upload a photo of a room and experiment with different wall colors or furniture arrangements.\n*   **Floorplan Creation:** A simplified floorplan creation tool allowing users to draw basic room layouts.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f5f5f5` (Light gray for a clean, spacious feel)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#007AFF` (Apple's blue, for primary actions and buttons)\n    *   Secondary: `#5AC8FA` (A lighter blue, for accents)\n    *   Accent: `#FF9500` (Orange, for highlights and interactive elements)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White, for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#D1E8FF` (Very light blue, for selections and focus states)\n*   **Typography:** Use the default system fonts for a native feel. They are generally clean and modern.\n\nHere's the plan for the coding agent:\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Update the `HomeScreen` component to include Pressable components for each of the core functionalities: Interior Design, Exterior Design, Landscaping, Virtual Staging, Floorplan Creation, and Material Overlay. Each `Pressable` should have an `IconSymbol` and a `Text` label. For now, these `Pressable` components can navigate to a simple screen indicating \"Functionality Coming Soon!\".\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T05:47:49.689799"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a spatial design tool app for homeowners, realtors, contractors, and designers.
